# Deep Learning code examples

These are a series of scripts that implement deep learning models.
The idea is to include examples of common architectures for a
set of Computer Vision tasks.

These examples are based on Keras, a popular deep learning framework.
The plan is to include PyTorch examples later on.
Feel free to submit bugs or contribute.
